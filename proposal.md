## Monstercat Music Visualizer Project Proposal

### Background

Monstercat is an independent electronic dance music record label with it's aesthetic music visualizer as one of its unique identifiers. A sample can be found at [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p13lhwtSaQc)
This project is to recreate the visualizer effects of Monstercat using Javascript and relevant libraries.

 **Functionality & MVP** and **Bonus Features** sections.  

### Functionality & MVP  

With this Monstercat Visualizer clone, users will be able to:

- [ ] Start and pause the music
- [ ] Skip to the next track

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with game board, game controls, and nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn,
and the About modal.  Game controls will include Start, Stop, and Reset buttons as well as a slider to control the speed.  On the left, three clickable shapes will be used to toggle between the types of grids available.  On the right, there will be three (or more) clickable gradient-filled rectangles used to toggle between color schemes (see Bonus Features).  Additionally, a drop-down will be added to the Controls to toggle between different rule sets (again, see Bonus Features).

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- `three.js` for audio analyzer and effects,
- `JQuery` for DOM manipulation,
- `Browserify` to bundle js files.


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Learn about audio analyzer and be able to connect to audio source.
**Day 2**: Generate sound waves and maybe background particles.
**Day 3**: Finalize styling and animate transitions.

### Bonus features

Try creating other visualizers.
